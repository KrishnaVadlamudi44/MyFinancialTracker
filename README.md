# My Financial Tracker
The goal of this application is to work on an idea that will help me experiment with latest web tech in the industry and learn different approaches and design patterns, their advantages and disadvantages.
My learning goal for application is building a secure web application and setting up CI/CD pipelines for automated integration and deployment.

## The Idea
The idea is like many other applications out their which will help you put together all your financial accounts in one place to get an overall picture of budgeting and spending. since we are dealing with financial accounts security is the key and that is my focus. I will be using Plaid to connect to financial institutions.

### Tech Stack Used
- .Net 5
- React with Typescript and Material UI for styled components
- Postgres Database
